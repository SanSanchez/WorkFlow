/*
    Purpose:
        To ease the task of finding and applying to jobs.

    Initial Proposal:
        Log into the command line what job I'm applying to, the position, contact information, the date, and
        possibly the time I should call back if I haven't heard back from them.
        Aside from that, allow for the addition and removal of jobs as necessary as well as the retrieval of
        inputted jobs.
